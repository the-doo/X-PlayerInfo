# X-PlayerInfo

I want to know damage/armor/speed/xp/movement...and any info of me.

So, this mod can do it.

You can press [TAB] when you want to show its.

Options:

mockTest: true/false - True is mock attack player, so maybe error in some mods like using waystone or other interrupable action, but the value will be preciser.

File is config/X-PlayerInfo.json
```
{
    "mockTest": "true"
}
```

Maybe no content, you can paste it on file to open it.
